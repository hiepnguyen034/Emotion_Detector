# Emotion_Detector
Detect facial expression using opencv and linear algebra

The model detects if the person in the image is sad, neutral, happy, or surprised

# Dependencies

`tensorflow, opencv`

# Accuracy

99.5% on the training set and 83% on my own images. This could be improved by editing the new images so that they look similar to the images in the train and dev sets (i.e. images should come from the same distribution)

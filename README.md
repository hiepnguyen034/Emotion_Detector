# Emotion_Detector
Detect facial expression using opencv and linear algebra

# Dependencies

`tensorflow, opencv`

#Accuracy

99.5% on the training set and 83% on my own images. This could improve by editing new images so that they look similar to the images in the train and dev sets (i.e. images should come from the same distribution)
